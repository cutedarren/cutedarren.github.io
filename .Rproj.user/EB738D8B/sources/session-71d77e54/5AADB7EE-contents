During my first year of university, I completed a four-month internship at **ST United**. This experience allowed me to bridge the gap between academic theory and industry practice, specifically in the realms of data engineering and business intelligence.

While my primary focus was on data, I also expanded my technical stack by learning **ReactJS** to understand how data is presented in modern web applications.

### Key Responsibilities & Learning Outcomes

* **Data Collection & Management**
    * Extracted and integrated data from diverse sources including **SQL** and **NoSQL**.
* **Advanced Analytics**
    * Utilized **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** and big data tools like **Spark** and **Hadoop**.
* **Visualization & Reporting**
    * Created interactive dashboards using **Power BI** and **Tableau**.
