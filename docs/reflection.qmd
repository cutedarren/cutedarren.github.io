## My Experience with Generative AI

As part of this assessment for SIT, I only utilize ChatGPT to generate paragraph texts to assist in the development of my Quarto website. As I do not face any difficulties in coding this assignment, no codes or suggestions were generated using GenAI.

### Final Thoughts
While GenAI is a powerful assistant, this assessment taught me that **human oversight is vital**. The AI provided the tools, but I had to provide the context, the data visualization story, and the verification to ensure the final product was accurate and representative of my work.
