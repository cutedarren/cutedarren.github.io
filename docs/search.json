    "text": "Challenges\nAs my account was not approved for the student and copilot yet, I was unable to have more tools to assist me in this assessment. However, I was still able to complete the assignment using my own knowledge and skills.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nWhile GenAI is a powerful assistant, this assessment taught me that human oversight is vital. The AI provided the tools, but I had to provide the context, the data visualization story, and the verification to ensure the final product was accurate and representative of my work."

    "text": "In my Year 2 module, Introduction to Software Engineering, my team and I developed a system to assist managers in sorting workload details and managing staff shifts. The core of this system is a data-driven dashboard that provides a clear overview of staff allocation and working hours.\n\n\n\n\n\nManager Sorting Workload Dashboard\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis dashboard encodes several key quantitative variables to help a manager make informed decisions: * Allocated Work Hours (Numerical): Represented by the height of the bars in the “Workload Visual” and detailed in the data table. * Staff Totals and Shift Counts (Numerical): Aggregated metrics shown at the top (e.g., 128 Total Staff, 580 Shifts) to provide a high-level summary of the week. * Workload Comparison (Ranked): The “Top 3 Lowest Staff WH” panel identifies workers with the least hours (e.g., James Mulligan at 8.0h) to highlight potential underutilization.\n\n\n\nThe Task: The primary challenge for managers in this project was avoiding burnout while ensuring all shifts were covered. I was responsible for designing the visualization that identified “at-risk” rosters where hours were distributed unevenly.\nThe Rationale behind the Visualization: * Bar Chart for Comparison: I chose a Bar Chart for the “Workload Visual” because it allows for an immediate comparison of hours across different employees (like John Sam vs. James Mulligan). * Sorted Data Table: Below the graph, I implemented a searchable and sortable table. This allows the manager to move from a high-level visual “trend” to specific quantitative details, such as checking certifications before reallocating a shift. * Color and Layout: I used a clean, high-contrast blue for the bars to ensure the quantitative data stands out against the neutral background, reducing cognitive load for the manager during busy roster periods.\n\n\n\n\n\nData Extraction: The dashboard fetches data from a SQL database containing staff IDs, roles, and scheduled shifts.\nProcessing: We used backend logic to calculate the Allocated Work Hours by summing the duration of all assigned shifts in the Roster Draft.\nFrontend Rendering: The visualization was built to be interactive, allowing managers to sort by Location or Allocated Work Hours to quickly find data outliers."
