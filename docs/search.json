    "text": "In my Year 2 module, Introduction to Software Engineering, my team and I developed a system to assist managers in sorting workload details and managing staff shifts. The core of this system is a data-driven dashboard that provides a clear overview of staff allocation and working hours.\n\n\n\n\n\nManager Sorting Workload Dashboard\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis dashboard encodes several key quantitative variables to help a manager make informed decisions: * Allocated Work Hours (Numerical): Represented by the height of the bars in the “Workload Visual” and detailed in the data table. * Staff Totals and Shift Counts (Numerical): Aggregated metrics shown at the top (e.g., 128 Total Staff, 580 Shifts) to provide a high-level summary of the week. * Workload Comparison (Ranked): The “Top 3 Lowest Staff WH” panel identifies workers with the least hours (e.g., James Mulligan at 8.0h) to highlight potential underutilization.\n\n\n\nThe Task: The primary challenge for managers in this project was avoiding burnout while ensuring all shifts were covered. I was responsible for designing the visualization that identified “at-risk” rosters where hours were distributed unevenly.\nThe Rationale behind the Visualization: * Bar Chart for Comparison: I chose a Bar Chart for the “Workload Visual” because it allows for an immediate comparison of hours across different employees (like John Sam vs. James Mulligan). * Sorted Data Table: Below the graph, I implemented a searchable and sortable table. This allows the manager to move from a high-level visual “trend” to specific quantitative details, such as checking certifications before reallocating a shift. * Color and Layout: I used a clean, high-contrast blue for the bars to ensure the quantitative data stands out against the neutral background, reducing cognitive load for the manager during busy roster periods.\n\n\n\n\n\nData Extraction: The dashboard fetches data from a SQL database containing staff IDs, roles, and scheduled shifts.\nProcessing: We used backend logic to calculate the Allocated Work Hours by summing the duration of all assigned shifts in the Roster Draft.\nFrontend Rendering: The visualization was built to be interactive, allowing managers to sort by Location or Allocated Work Hours to quickly find data outliers."

    "text": "In this section, I am sharing a visualization created during my internship at ST United, where I was tasked with identifying growth trends across different geographic regions.\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Sales Revenue Trends (2023-2024)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis visualization encodes several key quantitative variables: * Monthly Revenue (Numerical): Represented by the height of the bars to show absolute financial performance. * Profit Margin % (Numerical/Ratio): Represented by a secondary line graph overlaying the bars to show efficiency alongside volume. * Regional Categories (Categorical): Color-coded to distinguish between North America, APAC, and EMEA markets.\n\n\n\nThe Task: Management needed to understand why our revenue was increasing while our net profit remained stagnant. I was asked to visualize the relationship between sales volume and operational costs.\nThe Rationale behind the Visualization: * Choice of Dual-Axis Chart: I chose a combination of a Bar Chart and a Line Graph. The bars provide a clear comparison of monthly revenue (quantitative), while the line graph allows the eye to quickly track the trend of profit margins without cluttering the screen. * Color Strategy: I utilized a high-contrast color palette to ensure that the “Profit Margin” line was immediately distinguishable from the “Revenue” bars, preventing any misinterpretation of the numerical data. * Data Integrity: Unlike a purely artistic illustration, every element here corresponds to a specific data point from our SQL database, ensuring a high “data-to-ink” ratio that emphasizes accuracy over decoration.\n\n\n\n\nTo create this, I performed the following steps: 1. Data Extraction: Queried the sales database using SQL to aggregate monthly totals. 2. Processing: Used Python (Pandas) to calculate the percentage margin for each month. 3. Rendering: Exported the final result from Tableau for inclusion in this report."
